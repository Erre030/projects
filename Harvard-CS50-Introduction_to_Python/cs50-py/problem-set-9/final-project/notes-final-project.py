#questions to ask yourself:

    #1.What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
    #2.What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
    #3.If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
    #4.In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.
    #And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
    # What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

#Step 2 :
    #Create a README.md in your "~/project" folder that explains your project
        #file should include: project title, URL, description of project (template in course)
