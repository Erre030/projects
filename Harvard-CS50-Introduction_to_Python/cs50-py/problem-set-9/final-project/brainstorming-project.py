#expense tracker:

    #functionality/functions:

        #add_expense(amount, category, description, regularity of payment) --> adds expense (maybe use specific name or class to easily add/change/delete expenses)
            #--> e.g. 30$, food, weekly purchase, weekly

        #rm expense(...)    --> removes expense


        #summary_category(category-name):
            #summarizes expenses by category

        #summary_recurring(category-name):
            #summarizes expenses by regularity of payment

        #list_expenses():
            #list all expenses cretated

        #visualization():
            #generate chart of expenses


    #extensions:
        #export stats via csv
        #budget warning system
        #compare monthly expenses with each other (which specific payment was lower maybe?)
